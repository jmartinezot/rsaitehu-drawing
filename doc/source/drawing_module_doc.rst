Introduction to the Drawing Module
-------------------------------------------------

The Drawing module provides functions for visualizing and interacting with 3D geometries and objects. This module is designed for developers and researchers working with 3D data in applications such as computer graphics, CAD systems, and 3D modeling. It leverages powerful libraries like `matplotlib` and `open3d` to render and manipulate 3D visualizations.

Core Functionalities
--------------------

1. **Drawing 3D Planes**

    - **Function:** `draw_plane_as_lines_open3d(A, B, C, D, size=10, line_color=[1, 0, 0], grid_density=5, external_point=None)`
    - **Description:** Draws a plane in 3D space represented as a grid of lines using `open3d`. The grid density, plane size, and colors can be customized. If an external point is provided, the plane is centered around the point projected onto it.

2. **Visualizing Cube Faces**

    - **Function:** `draw_face_of_cube(plane, cube_min, cube_max, color="red", alpha=0.5, ax=None)`
    - **Description:** Renders a single face of a cube defined by a plane equation. The function allows transparency (`alpha`) and color customization. It uses `matplotlib` for visualization.

3. **Drawing 3D Cubes**

    - **Function:** `draw_cube(cube_min, cube_max, color="red", alpha=0.5, ax=None)`
    - **Description:** Visualizes a 3D cube by rendering its six faces, each represented by a plane. The function supports defining the cube's bounds, color, and transparency. It integrates seamlessly with `matplotlib`.
    
4. **Drawing Line Extensions to Planes**

    - **Function:** `draw_line_extension_to_plane(line, plane, ax=None)`
    - **Description:** Visualizes a line in 3D space and its extension to intersect with a given plane. This function also highlights the intersection point and is ideal for exploring line-plane relationships in geometry.


Use Cases
---------

- **3D Visualization:** Quickly render planes, cubes, and lines for analysis or presentation.
- **Geometric Analysis:** Visualize relationships between lines, planes, and bounding boxes in 3D space.
- **Interactive Debugging:** Use these visualizations to debug and validate geometric computations.

The `rsaitehu-drawing` module simplifies 3D rendering tasks, making it a valuable tool for researchers, engineers, and developers working on 3D data and geometry applications.
